Exercise 1: What is the function of the secondary memory in a computer?

a) Execute all of the computation and logic of the program
b) Retrieve web pages over the Internet
c) Store information for the long term, even beyond a power cycle
d) Take input from the user

Solution: c)
Secondary memory is used to store information no matter the computer is closed or not.

Exercise 2: What is a program?

Solution: The stored instructions expected to be executed by CPU(answer the problem "What's next?") is called a program.

Exercise 3: What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?

Solution: Regardless of the fact that compiler needs to be handed the entire program in a file, but interpreter takes programs line by line.
The essential difference is that compiler generates binary code(machine code), but interperter does not, it just converts into another type
of language.
#Python interpreter compiles .py files to .pyc files, which consists of bytecode, then python interpreters the bytecode.

Exercise 4: Which of the following contains "machine code"?

a) The Python interpreter
b) The keyboard
c) Python source file
d) A word processing document

Solution: a)

Exercise 5: What is wrong with the following code:

    >>> primt 'Hello world!'
      File "<stdin>", line 1
        primt 'Hello world!'
                           ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    >>>
Solution:		
>>> print('Hello world!')
Hello world!

Exercise 6: Where in the computer is a variable such as "x" stored after the following Python line finishes?

    x = 123
a) Central processing unit
b) Main Memory
c) Secondary Memory
d) Input Devices
e) Output Devices

Solution: b)

Exercise 7: What will the following program print out:

    x = 43
    x = x + 1
    print(x)
a) 43
b) 44
c) x + 1
d) Error because x = x + 1 is not possible mathematically

Solution: b)

Exercise 8:
Central processing unit==Brain
Main Memory            ==Knowledge in your brain
Secondary Memory       ==Knowledge outside you
Input Device           ==Knowledge in textbook which you intend to learn
Output Device          ==Knowledge you expose

Exercise 9: How do you fix a "Syntax Error"?

Solution:
  Find the grammar rules you break and replace it with a correct one according to the interpreter.
